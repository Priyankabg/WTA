Medicine donation
This system involved in the website has modules namely, Admin, Bank, Medicine Donation, Money Donation and fund for NGO.The NGO page consists of modules Admin, Bank, Medicine Donation, Money Donation and Fund for NGO. Admin page takes us to the admin login page where validation is done for the login. Requests from NGO in Admin displays the information of NGO which requested funds. Admin can delete the request from the database and remaining data will then be displayed on this page. NGO can search for medicine donors in their city by giving required medicine names and city names when required. If medicine is available in their city donor information will be displayed. If medicine is not available in that city a message will be displayed saying that particular medicine is not available for donation currently you can visit our fund page to get funds for that medicine. Information of the medicine donor(with validation of phone number) is taken as input (with submit and reset option) and stored in the database for later use. Funds can also be donated through credit card with card number and CVV being validated. Information is taken from the NGOs who are willing to work with us.
